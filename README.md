# Leaflet.MarkerCluster.LayerSupport
Sub-plugin for [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster)
plugin (MCG in short); brings compatibility with
[L.Control.Layers](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control-layers)
and other Leaflet [plugins](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html).
I.e. everything that uses direct calls to `map.addLayer` and `map.removeLayer`.
